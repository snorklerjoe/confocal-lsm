class Keycode:
    """USB HID Keycode constants.

    This list is modeled after the names for USB keycodes defined in
    http://www.usb.org/developers/hidpage/Hut1_12v2.pdf#page=58.
    THis list does not include every single code, but does include all the keys on
    a regular PC or Mac keyboard.

    Remember that keycodes are the names for key *positions* on a US keyboard, and may
    not correspond to the character that you mean to send if you want to emulate non-US keyboard.
    For instance, on a French keyboard (AZERTY instead of QWERTY),
    the keycode for 'q' is used to indicate an 'a'. Likewise, 'y' represents 'z' on
    a German keyboard. This is historical: the idea was that the keycaps could be changed
    without changing the keycodes sent, so that different firmware was not needed for
    different variations of a keyboard.
