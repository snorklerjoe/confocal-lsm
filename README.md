Hardware and software for my homemade laser-scanning confocal microscope

After reading [this Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/id/Laser-Scanning-Microscope/) and [this Hackaday article](https://hackaday.com/2017/02/15/speakers-make-a-laser-scanning-microscope/),
I thought it would be interesting to try my hand at building a laser scanning microscope from CD/DVD drive parts.
